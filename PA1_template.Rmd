# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## numbers >= 10^5 will be denoted in scientific notation,
## and rounded to 2 digits
options(scipen = 1, digits = 2)
```
## Loading and preprocessing the data

Unziping data in archive and reading a file.

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
raw <- read.csv("activity.csv")
head(raw)
```

Converting interval level column from int to char of length four, with appending zeroes at the front.


```{r}
raw <- transform(raw, interval = formatC(interval, width = 4, flag = 0))
head(raw)
```

Make a factor from the interval column and add it as a column.

```{r}
raw$interval.factor <- as.factor(raw$interval)
head(raw)
```

Add a column that simplifies and representing the timestamp of the observations.

```{r}
raw$timestamp <- strptime(with(raw, paste(date, interval, sep = " ")), "%Y-%m-%d %H%M")
head(raw)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Showing a histogram of daily total steps.

```{r}
cumSteps <- tapply(raw$steps, raw$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(cumSteps, breaks = 53, col = "steelblue", main = "Histogram of Daily Total Steps")
```

Calculate the mean and median daily total steps, still ignoring missing values.

```{r}
theSummary <- summary(cumSteps)
```

Total daily steps:
 - mean: `r theSummary[["Mean"]]`
 - median: `r theSummary[["Median"]]`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Now let's look at  averages for specific intervals of the day to see, on average, how active the user is at different times of day.

```{r}
intervalMean <- tapply(raw$steps, raw$interval.factor, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
head(intervalMean)
result <- require(lattice)
if (result == FALSE) {
    install.packages("lattice")
    library(lattice)
}
xyplot(intervalMean ~ sort(unique(unclass(raw$interval.factor))), type = "l", col = "steelblue", xlab = "interval", ylab = "interval mean")
```

Determine the 5-minute interval with the highest average total steps.

```{r}
maxIntervals <- intervalMean[abs(intervalMean - max(intervalMean)) < 1]
names(maxIntervals)
```

## Imputing missing values

Calculate the total number of rows with missing entries.

```{r}
length(which(!complete.cases(raw$steps, raw$date, raw$interval, raw$interval.factor, raw$timestamp)))
```

Personally notice that only the steps variable is containing the missing values.

```{r}
any(is.na(raw$date))
any(is.na(raw$interval))
any(is.na(raw$timestamp))
any(is.na(raw$steps))
```

infitate a strategy for filling in missing values.


```{r}
naStatus <- tapply(raw$steps, raw$date, is.na)
allWhole <- TRUE
for (name in names(naStatus)) {
    allTest <- TRUE
    if (!all(naStatus[[name]]) && !all(!naStatus[[name]])) {
        allWhole <- FALSE
        break
    }        
}
if (allWhole == TRUE) {
    print("Missing values only exist on days that have no values.")
} else {
    print("Some days with values also have missing values.")
}
```

Are the missing days interspersed amongst tracked days, or do they lie only on the outsides?

```{r}
naStatus <- tapply(raw$steps, raw$date, is.na)
dayMissing = logical()
for (name in names(naStatus)) {
    dayMissing <- c(dayMissing, any(naStatus[[name]]))
}
dayMissing
firstTrue <- FALSE
falsePastTrue <- FALSE
secondTrue <- FALSE
tailsMissingOnly <- TRUE
for (entry in dayMissing) {
    if (firstTrue == FALSE) {
        if (entry == TRUE) {
            firstTrue <- TRUE
        }
    } else if (falsePastTrue == FALSE) {
        if (entry == FALSE) {
            falsePastTrue <- TRUE
        }
    } else if (secondTrue == FALSE) {
        if (entry == TRUE) {
            tailsMissingOnly <- FALSE
        }
    }
}
if (tailsMissingOnly) {
    print("Missing days are only the outermost days of the set.")
} else
    print("Missing days are interspersed with tracked days.")
```

My strategy for filling in missing values is to:
 - ignore the first and last day which are missing and treat the data set as though it was taken over a window shorter by two days
 - set a missing value to be equal to the average of the same interval in the closest available previous and next day's interval of the same time
 
Create a second dataset that has the filled in missing values.

```{r}
dayList <- split(raw, raw$date)
toFill <- dayList
for (index in 2:(length(dayMissing) - 1)) {
    if (dayMissing[[index]] == TRUE) { #day is missing
        priorIndex <- NULL
        nextIndex <- NULL
        bookmark <- index
        while (is.null(priorIndex)) {
            bookmark <- bookmark - 1
            if (dayMissing[[bookmark]] == FALSE) {
                priorIndex <- bookmark
            }
        }
        bookmark <- index
        while (is.null(nextIndex)) {
            bookmark <- bookmark + 1
            if (dayMissing[[bookmark]] == FALSE) {
                nextIndex <- bookmark
            }
        }
        interpolationSet <- cbind(dayList[[priorIndex]]$steps, dayList[[index]]$steps, dayList[[nextIndex]]$steps)
        interpolationSet[,2] <- rowMeans(interpolationSet[,c(1,3)])
        toFill[[index]]$steps <- interpolationSet[,2]
    }
}
rm(dayList)
filled <- NULL

#iterate through list and bind to a dataframe
for (i in 2:(length(toFill) - 1)) {
    if (is.null(filled)) {
        filled <- toFill[[i]]
    } else {
        filled <- rbind(filled, toFill[[i]])
    }
}

rm(toFill)
summary(filled)
```

How did filling in missing values affect daily total steps?

Display a histogram of daily total steps.

```{r}
cumSteps <- tapply(filled$steps, filled$date, sum, na.rm = FALSE)
hist(cumSteps, breaks = 53, col = "steelblue", main = "Histogram of Daily Total Steps")
```

Calculate the mean and median daily total steps, still ignoring missing values.

```{r}
theSummary <- summary(cumSteps)
```

Total daily steps:
 - mean: `r theSummary[["Mean"]]`
 - median: `r theSummary[["Median"]]`

These values are higher with additional data, as expected, but additional they appear much more normal, with the mean equal to the median.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
weekdays(filled[1,"timestamp"])
```

The first tracked day is a Tuesday.

Factor observations into weekdays and weekends.

```{r}
# starting with Tuesday is 4 weekdays, two weekends, and final the weekday of Monday
weekpart <- factor(c(rep("weekday", 4), rep("weekend", 2), "weekday"))
weekpart <- rep(weekpart, nrow(filled) / 7 + 1)
filled$weekpart <- weekpart[1:nrow(filled)]
head(filled)
```

Compare interval averages separated by type of type.

```{r}
intervalMean <- tapply(filled$steps, filled$interval.factor, mean, na.rm = FALSE)
xyplot(intervalMean ~ sort(unique(unclass(filled$interval.factor))) | filled$weekpart, type = "l", col = "steelblue", xlab = "interval", ylab = "interval mean", layout = c(1,2))
```

Activity levels are fairly consistent regardless of day type.
